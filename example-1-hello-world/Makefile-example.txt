"A simple makefile consists of “rules” with the following shape:" - GNU Make Manual 2.1

target … : prerequisites …
        recipe
        …
        …

Lets define these terms:
	Prerequisite: A file used as input to create the "target." 
	Example: I need a Markdown file to generate HTML
	Recipe: The action "make" carries out, how to generate the output file.
	Example: To generate an HTML file with cmark (Common Mark)

Lets put this together
Makefile

Note: Makefiles require tabs
Note: First target is what is run with "make", other targets can be run with, for example, "make <target>"
